Software Requirement Specification (SRS) for MoneyMonster Expert Advisor (EA) on MetaTrader 5 for XRPUSD
Last Updated: April 19, 2025

1. Introduction
Name: MoneyMonster
This Software Requirement Specification (SRS) details the requirements for an Expert Advisor (EA) developed for scalp trading the XRPUSD (XRP/USD) pair on the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The EA leverages a multi-timeframe strategy, utilizing the 1-minute (1M) chart for precise trade entries, the 5-minute (5M) chart for signal generation, and the 15-minute (15M) chart for trend confirmation. It automates trade execution, position management, and risk control, providing a robust tool for traders aiming to capitalize on short-term price movements in XRPUSD.

2. Scope
The EA is designed to:
* Analyze real-time XRPUSD price data across multiple timeframes (1M, 5M, 15M).
* Generate trading signals using technical indicators.
* Execute and manage trades with a multi-TP system and dynamic SL adjustments.
* Implement advanced risk management and performance tracking features.
* Provide comprehensive visual feedback on trade status and performance metrics.
This SRS defines the full functionality required to meet these objectives, ensuring the EA operates efficiently within the MT5 environment.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Data Access and Timeframes
* Description: The EA accesses real-time XRPUSD tick and candlestick data via MT5.
* Details:
    * Timeframes: 1-minute (1M), 5-minute (5M), and 15-minute (15M) charts.
    * Data is retrieved directly from the MT5 terminal for analysis and trade decisions.

3.2 Technical Indicators
* Description: The EA supports a range of technical indicators to generate signals and confirm trends.
* Details:
    * Supported indicators: Moving Averages (MA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands, Average Directional Index (ADX), and Average True Range (ATR).
    * Users can customize indicator parameters (e.g., periods, levels) through MT5 input settings.
    * Each indicator can be enabled/disabled individually to fine-tune the strategy.
    * The EA validates indicator initialization at startup and gracefully handles missing indicators.

3.3 Signal Generation and Trend Confirmation
* Description: Trading signals are generated and validated across multiple timeframes.
* Details:
    * Signal Generation (5M): Signals are detected on the 5M chart using indicators (e.g., MA crossover, RSI overbought/oversold levels).
    * Trend Confirmation (15M): The 15M chart confirms the market trend using indicators such as MA direction or ADX strength.

3.4 Trade Entry
* Description: Trades are executed on the 1M chart based on validated signals.
* Details:
    * Entry occurs when a 5M signal aligns with the 15M trend, and a specific condition is met on the 1M chart (e.g., a price action trigger like a candlestick pattern or breakout).
    * Trade entry logic is fully documented in the code with detailed comments.
    * Position size is dynamically calculated based on risk parameters and market volatility.

3.5 Multi-TP System
* Description: The EA implements a multi-take-profit system with four levels (TP1, TP2, TP3, TP4) to manage winning trades.
* Details:
    * TP levels are user-defined, either as pips from the entry price or as specific price levels.
    * Trade management at each TP level:
        * TP1 Hit:
            * Closes 40% of the position.
            * Moves the stop-loss (SL) to the entry price.
        * TP2 Hit:
            * Closes 20% of the position.
            * Moves the SL to the TP1 level.
        * TP3 Hit:
            * Closes 20% of the position.
            * Moves the SL to the TP2 level.
        * Midway to TP4:
            * When the price reaches the midpoint between TP3 and TP4 (calculated as the average of TP3 and TP4 prices), moves the SL to the TP3 level.
        * TP4 Hit:
            * Closes the remaining 20% of the position.
    * Example (for a long position):
        * Entry: 1910
        * TP1: 1915 (40% closed, SL → 1910)
        * TP2: 1920 (20% closed, SL → 1915)
        * TP3: 1925 (20% closed, SL → 1920)
        * Midway (1927.5): SL → 1925
        * TP4: 1930 (remaining 20% closed)

3.6 Dynamic SL for Losing Trades
* Description: When a trade is in a losing position, the SL is dynamically adjusted to minimize losses.
* Details:
    * Applies when the price is between the entry price and the original SL (i.e., the trade is in loss but hasn't hit the original SL).
    * Adjustment Logic:
        * For long positions: SL = max(original SL, min(entry, current price - distance))
        * For short positions: SL = min(original SL, max(entry, current price + distance))
    * Distance: User-defined (e.g., 5-10 pips) or calculated dynamically (e.g., based on ATR).
    * Behavior: The SL follows the current price, maintaining the specified distance, but is constrained between the original SL and entry price.
    * Termination: This adjustment ceases once TP1 is hit and the SL is moved to the entry price.
    * Example (for a long position):
        * Entry: 1910, Original SL: 1900, Distance: 5 pips
        * Price at 1905: SL = max(1900, min(1910, 1905 - 5)) = max(1900, 1900) = 1900
        * Price at 1908: SL = max(1900, min(1910, 1908 - 5)) = max(1900, 1903) = 1903
        * Price at 1906: SL = max(1900, min(1910, 1906 - 5)) = max(1900, 1901) = 1901

3.7 Trailing Stop Functionality
* Description: The EA implements a comprehensive trailing stop mechanism to secure profits.
* Details:
    * Trailing Stop Parameters:
        * Trailing_Start: Minimum price movement in pips from entry before trailing begins.
        * Trailing_Step: Minimum price movement in pips required to adjust the SL.
        * Trailing_Distance: Distance in pips to maintain between current price and SL.
    * Implementation:
        * For buy positions: SL moves up when price advances significantly, maintaining trailing distance.
        * For sell positions: SL moves down when price declines significantly, maintaining trailing distance.
        * The trailing stop only moves in the favorable direction (never worsens the SL).
    * User Configuration: All trailing stop parameters are customizable via input settings.

3.8 Gap Protection
* Description: The EA includes protection against market gaps to minimize losses during volatile price movements.
* Details:
    * Continuously monitors for significant price gaps between consecutive candles.
    * When a gap exceeds the user-defined threshold (Max_Gap_Size):
        * If the gap is against the position: Reduces position size by 50% or closes entirely for extremely large gaps.
        * Logs warnings about detected gaps and actions taken.
    * Parameters are fully customizable through input settings.

3.9 Position Sizing and Risk Management
* Description: The EA calculates position sizes and enforces risk limits.
* Details:
    * Position Size: Based on a user-defined risk percentage (e.g., 1-2% of account balance).
    * Volatility-Adjusted Risk:
        * Uses ATR to assess current market volatility.
        * Adjusts position size based on volatility ratio (current ATR vs. base stop loss).
        * Risk factor can be customized to increase/decrease sensitivity to volatility.
    * Daily Loss Limit: Trading stops if losses exceed a user-specified threshold (e.g., 5% of account balance).

3.10 Automation
* Description: The EA fully automates trading operations.
* Details:
    * Executes trades, manages partial closures, and adjusts SL according to the multi-TP and dynamic SL rules.
    * Operates without manual intervention once configured.
    * Implements error handling and recovery mechanisms for robustness.

3.11 Visualization and User Interface

        * Indicates which TP levels have been hit with checkmarks.
    * All visualization elements are fully customizable and can be enabled/disabled.

3.12 Enhanced Logging System

    * Log Levels:
        * Critical (1): Major errors and important alerts.
        * Important (2): Standard operational information.
        * Debug (3): Detailed diagnostic information.
    * Debug Mode: Enables/disables verbose logging for development and troubleshooting.
    * Format: Timestamp + level indicator + message content.
    * Critical messages trigger MT5 alerts for immediate attention.

3.13 Backtesting and Performance Tracking
